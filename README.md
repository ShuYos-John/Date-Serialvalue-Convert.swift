# Date-Serialvalue-Convert.swift

Dear friends

ConvertDatetoSerial is a function which converts “Date” described in type of String into “Serialvalue” in type of Double. Please insert any Day with Time as a format of "yyyy/MM/dd,hh:mm" at variation field. After calling function, the serial value will be stored in the variation "SerialValue".

SerialtoDate is a function which converts serial value into “Date” in type of String. Please change variation “DateSerialvalue” to any. After calling function, each variation “year”, “month” and “day” will be stored in the "Date". In this funtion, the digits under the decimal point of “Serialvalue” will be ignored. If you need to express hour and minit, call “Hour” and “Minit” after delete all //, /* and */.

This is made with attention to leap year especially due to the fact that the year divisible by 100 is NOT leap year and divisible by 400 IS leap year. It is created with perfect consideration towards leap year. Use at your ease!

John
